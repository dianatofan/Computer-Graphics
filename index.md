* [Part 2](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dianatofan/Computer-Graphics/blob/master/Week%204/Ex_02/index.html) - Use depth buffer and back face culling to remove hidden surfaces.

* [Part 3](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dianatofan/Computer-Graphics/blob/master/Week%204/EX_03/index.html) - Use Gouraud shading (with true normals) to draw a diffuse sphere lit by a distant, white, directional light with direction (0, 0, −1).

* [Part 4](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dianatofan/Computer-Graphics/blob/master/Week%204/Ex_04/index.html) - Implement the full Phong reflection model in the vertex shader and create sliders for material parameters and light emission.

* [Part 5](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dianatofan/Computer-Graphics/blob/master/Week%204/Ex_05/index.html) - Use Phong shading by moving your implementation of the Phong reflection
model to the fragment shader and varying positions and normals across triangles instead of colors.

* [Part 6](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dianatofan/Computer-Graphics/blob/master/Week%201/Ex_05/index.html) - Answers to the questions

* [Part 2, 3](http://www.student.dtu.dk/~s172393/Computer%20Graphics/Week%205/Part%203/) - Load and display the teapot 3D model with the associated MTL file (if used) to the server.

* [Part 4](http://www.student.dtu.dk/~s172393/Computer%20Graphics/Week%205/Part%204/) - Use Gouraud shading (with true normals) to draw a diffuse sphere lit by a distant, white, directional light with direction (0, 0, −1).

**Worksheet 6: Texture mapping** - [Source code](https://github.com/dianatofan/Computer-Graphics/tree/master/Week%206)

* [Part 1](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dianatofan/Computer-Graphics/blob/master/Week%206/Ex_01/index.html) - Map a procedurally generated checkerboard texture to a rectangle.

* [Part 2](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dianatofan/Computer-Graphics/blob/master/Week%206/Ex_02/index.html) - Create buttons and/or selection menus that enable you to switch between
different texture wrapping modes (repeat or clamp-to-edge) and different texture filtering modes (nearest, linear, mipmap).
